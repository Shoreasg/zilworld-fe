# Introduction

This is a improvement of Zilverse. Zilliqa is a blockchain and it has many different
projects. However, there isn't a place to find out more information on these projects. I
have created this website where users can find out all of the latest information of the
projects and tweets from them by using Next13, Typescript, Mongoose and Express. This
project is live and will be updated when there are new projects in the ecosystem



# Features:

- User is able to find projects and tokens in the ecosystem
- User is able to submit new projects and tokens in the ecosystem.
